# SweSAT-1.0: A Benchmark for Swedish LLMs

SweSAT-1.0 is a benchmark dataset created from the Swedish university entrance exam (*Högskoleprovet*) to assess large language models (LLMs) in Swedish. It includes **867 multiple-choice questions** from the last 8 exams (2020-10-25 to 2024-04-13), covering  the following six different question types: 

- **ORD** (Vocabulary) - Tests the understanding of in-domain words and synonyms.
- **LÄS** (Reading Comprehension) - Assesses the ability to make inferences from a text.
- **MEK** (Sentence Completion) - Evaluates the ability to complete sentences via cloze tests.
- **XYZ** (Mathematical Problem-Solving) - Includes questions on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics, and functions.
- **KVA** (Quantitative Comparisons) - Measures the ability to compare quantities in mathematical concepts.
- **NOG** (Data Sufficiency) - Determines the ability to assess whether given data is sufficient to solve a problem.
